        <ul>
            <li>Components are independent and reusable bits of code. They serve the same purpose as JavaScript functions, but work in isolation and return HTML.</li>
            <li>Components come in two types, Class components and Function components, in this tutorial we will concentrate on Function components.</li>
        </ul>
