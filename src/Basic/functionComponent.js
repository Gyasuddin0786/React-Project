      <p>
        Here is the same example as above, but created using a Function
        component instead.
      </p>
      <p>
        A Function component also returns HTML, and behaves much the same way as
        a Class component, but Function components can be written using much
        less code, are easier to understand, and will be preferred in this
        tutorial.
